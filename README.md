## Getting Started

### 1.Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Solar-system

### 2.Install dependencies

```bash
npm install

### 3.Set up environment variables 
Create a .env.local file in the project root and add -

```bash
VITE_NASA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

### 4.Run locally:

```bash
npm run dev

## Deployment Notes

If you're deploying to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages:

Set your VITE_NASA_API_KEY as an environment variable in the hosting dashboard.

## Built With

React 18

Three.js

React Three Fiber

Vite

NASA APIs

## NOTE

GitHub Pages does not support securely handling environment variables, which means there's no way to use an API key without exposing it publicly.
As a result, I deployed the project on Vercel, which allows secure environment variable management and production-ready hosting.
